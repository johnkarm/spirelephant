# Spirelephant
This game was developed in EECS 495 by John Banna, Sam Ajami, Anjali Vyas, and Sarah Kunkel, with the help of Dr. Chesney and GSI David Nie.

**Purpose of Spirelephant** </br>
After lung surgery or conditions like Pneumonia, your lung capacity can drop due to sacs in your lungs called alveoli closing up. Patients are given a medical tool called a spirometer to help them slowly regain their lung capacity. You use a spirometer by breathing with it, and it must be used multiple times an hour. However, patients, and especially children, often do not keep up with it. Our team's project incentivizes the use of the spirometer for these patients.

**What is Spirelephant?** </br>
The Spirelephant game encourages young children to use their incentive spirometers more correctly and more often. Whenever the children breathe in correctly Elly the elephant will perform tasks such as sucking in water from a river or fruit from trees to help her animal friends. They will be rewarded with fruit points and fun facts and will also be able to "buy" a Wolverine costume.
